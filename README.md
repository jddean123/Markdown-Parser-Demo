# Markdown-Parser-Demo
Demo parser for markdown scripting

## Getting started

Clone the repo and open it in any browser. It's pure JS, jQuery and HTML, so no server needed!

Click parse to convert the sample script or replace the sample script with whatever you'd like! Preview the HTML by clicking on the `Show/Hide HTML` button at the bottom right of the screen.

Please note, this does not incorporate the entire Markdown scripting language, just the most regularly used elements including Heading 1-6, code blocks, inline code, blockquotes, basic text formatting, ordered/unordered lists, links, images, and horizontal rules.
